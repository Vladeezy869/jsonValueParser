## running 
I run this code using "VSCode Code Runner" extension.

## what does it do
The "findElems" function goes through the .json file, finds objects and looks for 
the matches with following params: "objectType" : "activity" & externalObjectType:"Email" in objects.

If the element exists, the function prints text message about it and object's ID.

## vars

counter: it counts how many there are matches;

helper: if the match is only one, we use this var to get the index of object we need 
to print that object filtered;
